# MNIST_NN

#The file "MNIST Neural Network.ipynb" is a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a neural network for the MNIST digit recognition task.

#The notebook includes:

#Code to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
#Functions to initialize neural network parameters, perform forward propagation, apply activation functions (ReLU and softmax), and compute backpropagation.
#A gradient descent function to train the neural network.
#Helper functions to visualize training examples and test predictions.
#The notebook trains a neural network on the MNIST dataset and evaluates its performance, including printing predictions and true labels for specific examples.
